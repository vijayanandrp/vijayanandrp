Encrypt and decrypt a file
The example program uses AWS KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt a file.

A master key, also called a Customer Master Key or CMK, is created and used to generate a data key.
The data key is then used to encrypt a disk file. 
The encrypted data key is stored within the encrypted file. 
To decrypt the file, the data key is decrypted and then used to decrypt the rest of the file.
This manner of using master and data keys is called envelope encryption.
