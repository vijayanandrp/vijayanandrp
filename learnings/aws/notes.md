**What is AWS CloudFormation?** 

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.

You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; AWS CloudFormation handles all of that.

my words: AWS Cloud formation is a service to create, edit and manage all my infrastructure resources required to host a application in AWS(cloud). I can concentrate on the code, app development and new feaures for app instead of infrastructure works. 

***The following scenarios demonstrate how AWS CloudFormation can help***
1. Simplify Infrastructure Management
2. Quickly Replicate Your Infrastructure
3. Easily Control and Track Changes to Your Infrastructure
