**Bigtable** is the recommended database for time series data that requires high throughput reads and writes.

Example:
You are building the trading platform for a stock exchange with millions of traders. 
Trading data is written rapidly. You need to retrieve data quickly to show visualizations to the traders,
such as the changing price of a particular stock over time. 
You need to choose a storage solution in Google Cloud. What should you do?
