Add Number from Last Week
=========================
LEAD lets you get data from rows further down (below) in the results, 
LAG lets you get data from rows further up (above) in the results.

As we’re ordering by order date in ascending order,
the earlier orders are further up the results, so we can use LAG.

We use LAG to get a value from an order date from one week ago, or seven days.

LAG is used as an analytic function, so we specify the OVER clause and the ORDER BY clause to define how the data is searched.

  ISSUE WITH QUERY 
  ===============
  	The LAG function will look at rows that are 7 rows earlier than the current row. Ideally, this means that it’s 7 days in the past.

	However, the order_date values come from the cust_order table, and there is no guarantee that there will be an order every day.

    LAG Function won't identify the missing days in past.
